- 👋 Hi, I’m @RobertHGit
- 👀 I’m interested in machine learning and designing, developing, and testing Python code that can translate data into actionable insights and valuable deliverables.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning containerisation for building and running cloud native python.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on building a B2C payment app which runs on the cloud and uses edge computing to make money gifts easy.
